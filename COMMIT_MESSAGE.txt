feat: Add comprehensive fee distribution, liquidity withdrawal, and authorization tests

## Summary
Added complete test coverage for fee distribution tracking, liquidity withdrawal 
mechanisms, and authorization controls. Implemented liquidity withdrawal instruction
to enable LP creation after bonding curve graduation.

## New Features

### Liquidity Withdrawal System
- Add `withdraw_liquidity` instruction for post-graduation LP creation
- Implement PDA signing for SOL vault and curve token account transfers
- Add `NotGraduated` error for pre-graduation withdrawal attempts
- Create liquidity.rs module with WithdrawLiquidity accounts struct
- Support transferring all SOL and tokens from PDAs to DEX pools

### Test Suite Enhancements (31 tests total, all passing)
- Add 5 fee distribution and liquidity tests
- Add 10 comprehensive authorization tests
- Verify fee recipient receives all trading fees (1%)
- Verify SOL vault holds trading proceeds for LP creation
- Verify curve token account holds unsold tokens
- Test unauthorized access prevention for restricted operations
- Confirm permissionless trading (buy/sell) works correctly

## Implementation Details

### Files Added
- `programs/notmarket-solana/src/liquidity.rs` - Liquidity withdrawal logic
- `FEE_AND_LIQUIDITY_ANALYSIS.md` - Technical analysis of fee flow
- `FEE_AND_LIQUIDITY_VERIFIED.md` - Complete verification documentation
- `AUTHORIZATION_TESTING.md` - Authorization model documentation

### Files Modified
- `programs/notmarket-solana/src/lib.rs` - Add liquidity module and instruction
- `programs/notmarket-solana/src/errors.rs` - Add NotGraduated error
- `tests/notmarket-solana.ts` - Add 15 new tests for fees, liquidity, and auth

## Fee Distribution (Verified)
- Buy transactions: token_cost → sol_vault, fee (1%) → fee_recipient
- Sell transactions: net_proceeds → seller, fee (1%) → fee_recipient
- Platform fee: 100 bps (1%) on all trades
- Fee recipient: Regular account set during launchpad initialization

## Liquidity Holdings (Verified)
- SOL Vault PDA: Holds all SOL from token purchases (~$12k at graduation)
- Curve Token Account: Holds 200M tokens reserved for LP creation
- Both accounts verified with proper PDA ownership and rent-exemption

## Authorization Model (Verified)
### Restricted Operations (Creator/Authority Only)
- `initialize_launchpad` - Wallet authority only
- `toggle_token_launch_active` - Token creator only
- `update_metadata_uri` - Token creator only
- `withdraw_liquidity` - Token creator only

### Permissionless Operations
- `create_token_launch` - Any user can create tokens
- `buy_tokens` - Any user can buy (permissionless trading)
- `sell_tokens` - Any token holder can sell
- `get_buy_quote` - Any user can query prices

## Security Mechanisms Tested
- ✅ has_one constraint enforcement on TokenLaunch.creator
- ✅ has_one constraint enforcement on LaunchpadConfig.authority
- ✅ PDA derivation prevents address spoofing
- ✅ Signer verification on all mutations
- ✅ Unauthorized access properly blocked
- ✅ Attack vectors tested and mitigated

## Test Results
```
31 passing (7s)
✅ Initialization tests
✅ Token creation tests
✅ Buying tokens tests
✅ Selling tokens tests
✅ Token launch management tests
✅ Authorization tests (10 new)
✅ Get buy quote tests
✅ Graduation logic tests
✅ Account state verification tests
✅ Fee distribution & liquidity tests (5 new)
```

## Breaking Changes
None - All changes are additive

## Usage Example
```typescript
// After bonding curve graduates (800M tokens + $12k SOL)
await program.methods
  .withdrawLiquidity()
  .accounts({
    tokenLaunch: tokenLaunchPda,
    bondingCurve: bondingCurvePda,
    solVault: solVaultPda,
    curveTokenAccount,
    solRecipient: dexPoolAddress,
    tokenRecipient: dexTokenAccount,
    authority: creator.publicKey,
    tokenProgram: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  })
  .signers([creator])
  .rpc();
```
